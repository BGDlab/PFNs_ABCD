# PFNs_ABCD

This contains scripts for a study in ABCD relating personalized funcitonal networks (PFNs) to p-factor, PRS-F1, and PRS-F2. Also includes scripts related to heritabiltiy of PFNs and p-factor.

ks_networks_7 contains scripts related primarily to p-factor ~ PFN relationships and p-factor + PFN heritability.
  
  Step_1. LME models of PFN size and p-factor
  
  Step_2. Ridge regression of PFNs fit to p-factor
  
  Step_3. Plotting ridge results
  
  Step_4. Haufe transformation of regression weights
  
  Step_5. Weight interpretation
  
  Step_6. Plotting heritabiltiy of PFNs and p-factor
  
  Step_7. Variability of PFNs

F1+F2_Scripts contains scripts related primarily to PRS-F1/F2 ~ p-factor and PRS-F1/F2 ~ PFN relationships.
  
  Step_1. LME models of PRS-F1/F2 and p-factor
  
  Step_2. Ridge regression of PFNs fit to PRS-F1/F2
  
  Step_3. Plotting ridge results
  
  Step_4. Haufe transformation of regression weights
  
  Step_5. Weight interpretation
  
  Step_6. Correlation testing of p-factor, PRS-F1/F2 maps
